    "content": "In the spring of 2014, a trans-anarchist Google engineer petitioned the White House to arrest our national decline. The plan was snappy: “1. Retire all government employees with full pensions. 2. Transfer administrative authority to the tech industry. 3. Appoint Eric Schmidt CEO of America.” Schmidt, then the chairman of Google, was an avatar of technocratic liberalism. Two decades earlier, as the largely unknown C.T.O. of Sun Microsystems, he helped Bill Clinton set up the first White House Web site, and, by the time of the Obama Administration, he served as Silicon Valley’s unofficial consul to the Democratic Party. Schmidt was not himself a company “founder,” a technologist’s most regal credential, but he had performed as an able steward: when Larry Page and Sergey Brin struggled to reconcile their competing visions for Google’s first corporate jet—Brin wanted a California king bed, Page did not—Schmidt negotiated a compromise. He was sensible and civic-minded. He was the adult in the room.\n\nIn those days, Silicon Valley was perceived as an apolitical place. People in the industry were associated with a naïve techno-utopianism—the belief that problems of governance might be properly demystified as problems of engineering. They might have made libertarian or even anarcho-capitalist noises from time to time, but their underlying commitments were more or less progressive. Peter Thiel espoused the view that freedom and democracy were incompatible, and he likened the most capable founders to dictators, but these ideas seemed idiosyncratic and vain rather than dangerous. The Google engineer’s petition in favor of a Valley-backed coup was taken as a spoof. It wasn’t. A “neoreactionary” vanguard had arisen in the Bay Area. Its objective was not to retreat from the citadels of governance but to place them under siege. The Google engineer had been influenced by an obscure programmer-monarchist named Curtis Yarvin, a.k.a. Mencius Moldbug. America, Yarvin declared, suffered from “chronic kinglessness.” Silicon Valley, where the best companies were run by executive fiat, knew how to make the trains run on time.\n\nDiscover the year’s essential reads in fiction and nonfiction.\n\nToday Yarvin, whom J. D. Vance has cited as an influence, is practically a household name. Yarvin, in his modesty, only ever called for one king. Now we appear to have two. Donald Trump and Elon Musk seem to share the aim of personal enrichment. Their avowed priorities do not otherwise cohere, at least at first glance. Trump is a nationalist who looks to the past and promises its restoration. He would like to take Greenland. Musk is a free marketeer who looks to the future and promises its realization. He would like to take Mars. Liberals might take solace in their partnership’s apparent fundamental instability. This may be a coping mechanism.\n\n“The Technological Republic: Hard Power, Soft Belief, and the Future of the West,” a new book by Alexander C. Karp, the C.E.O. of the software company Palantir Technologies, and his aide-de-camp Nicholas W. Zamiska, demonstrates how these attitudes might profitably fit together. Although Karp dislikes Trump, he appeals to a more muscular America. And, although he admires Musk, he would prefer that the government remain intact. The book’s central claim is that the survival of the American experiment depends on the technological revitalization of the military-industrial complex. National pride ought to provide Silicon Valley with a sense of purpose. Silicon Valley’s talents might in turn mend our sense of national competence. From our desire to take Greenland might flow our ability to take Mars.\n\nWith the possible exception of Peter Thiel’s “Zero to One,” which is one of the more strapping examples of the business-and-self-help crossover genre, most books by tech mandarins are disappointing. Karp seems like the sort of person who might have improved the canon. He was raised, outside of Philadelphia, by a Jewish pediatrician and a Black artist, and routed himself from Haverford College to Stanford Law School. The only redeeming part of his time at Stanford, which he otherwise hated, was having Thiel as a classmate. The two shared the intimate antagonism of “feral animals,” as Karp once put it, and they spent late nights locked into debates about the relative virtues of socialism and capitalism. (Thiel represented capitalism.) Karp proceeded to a doctoral program in philosophy at Goethe University Frankfurt, the home of the Institute for Social Research, which gave rise to the legendary “Frankfurt School.” He briefly studied under Jürgen Habermas, whose evaluation of the “legitimation crisis” appears to have made an impression on him. In 2003, Thiel started Palantir and soon after, recruited Karp to run it.\n\nPalantir, which was named for the “seeing stones” in “The Lord of the Rings,” had twin inspirations. One was the dot-com collapse, which flattened the bubbly frivolity of early e-commerce. The other was September 11th. Thiel believed that a maturing tech industry needed to put away its eToys.com and devote itself to the serious business of national defense. Palantir’s data-integration platform pledged to discern obscure patterns that might otherwise elude human analysts. The company’s overarching ambition, Karp has said, was “to support the West”—in the local dialect, they were “saving the Shire” from the eye of Sauron. The Thiel-Karp team guaranteed a reasonable calibration of “total information awareness” and the protection of civil liberties. They were criticized from both flanks. Civil libertarians inevitably likened their products to the glittering touch screens in the predictive-policing dystopia of “Minority Report.” Other skeptics accused them of peddling vaporware. Selling infrastructure to the panopticon was not a safe play, and investors were skittish. Employees considered their public reputation unfair and inaccurate, but their communications team recognized that a sinister aura was great marketing. A small raft of contracts, along with support from the C.I.A.’s venture arm, kept them afloat until the world readied itself for their relevance. Today their market capitalization is two hundred and eighty billion dollars.\n\n“The Technological Republic” is equal parts company lore, jeremiad, and homily. It begins with a bracing precis of the cultural, political, and technological posture of “the West,” a concept that has been lamentably “discarded by many, almost casually.” Our government “has retreated from the pursuit of the kind of large-scale breakthroughs that gave rise to the atomic bomb and the internet.” Silicon Valley has “turned inward, focusing its energy on narrow consumer products,” and abdicating its more profound responsibilities. Only with jointly redoubled efforts will we construct “the technology and artificial intelligence capabilities that will address the most pressing challenges that we collectively face.” Chief among these challenges are the threats posed by an A.I.-enhanced posse of China, Russia, and Iran. The real enemy, however, is already in the house. Our society is rudderless and soft. The book’s diagnosis recalls the “post-liberalism” common to many thinkers on the new right: “The vital yet messy questions of what constitutes a good life, which collective endeavors society should pursue, and what a shared and national identity can make possible have been set aside as the anachronisms of another age.”\n\nThe book, too, is an anachronism of another age—an age called “last October”—and its vision of a mutually supportive relationship between Washington and Silicon Valley has in the interim been rendered almost quaint. Karp supported the campaigns of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and “The Technological Republic” was manifestly intended as an intervention in the status-quo context of a Democratic victory. The book imagines a more active government, not no government at all. Karp’s political aim reflects an attempt to resuscitate what is now frequently disparaged as Cold War liberalism, or the belief that we fought for freedom and comfort on two fronts—that the struggle for equality at home was tied to the struggle against Communism abroad. The atomic program, which was a win-win contribution to both overseas deterrence and domestic progress, is Karp’s model for how we might approach the dual-use technologies of artificial intelligence. The A.I. arms race, like its nuclear precursor, is poised to reshape the global order, and we cede first-mover advantage to China at our peril.\n\nThere are reasons to mistrust such fortune-telling, especially from people with a vested interest in the outcome. Arms races aren’t just idle predictions; they are self-fulfilling prophecies. The book’s inferences about the present state of A.I. are less controversial and more trenchant. The remarkable pace of A.I. development throws into relief the degree to which our engineering talent has been poorly deployed. We ought to expect better things from startups than improved advertising technology, stupid farm games, and luxury appurtenances for twentysomething urbanites.\n\nThe question is how this happened. Many of Karp’s colleagues blame the government for regulating away their ability to do interesting things. Karp has little patience for Washington bureaucracy, but the primary target of “The Technological Republic” is not a nation that has failed Silicon Valley. It is more cogent and original as a story about how Silicon Valley has failed the nation. The employees are spoiled and the investors are cowards. The tech barons are mere clerks and shopkeepers in disguise. Engineers and executives have lost their taste for rockets and spy planes. In the spring of 2018, Google employees protested against the company’s participation in Project Maven, a Department of Defense initiative to better analyze reconnaissance imagery. Their misgivings, Karp and Zamiska write, did not reflect “a principled commitment to pacifism or non-violence,” but “a more fundamental abandonment of belief in anything” other than their own bourgeois comfort. Palantir stepped into the breach and picked up that contract. The company has not only accepted their grave obligations to national defense; it has fought for the right to serve the country. The Defense Department’s byzantine procurement policies had ruled out the use of Palantir’s commercially available software. In 2016, Palantir sued the government and won. Two years later, it was awarded an enormous Army contract.\n\nUnder a Harris Administration, “The Technological Republic” might have been brushed aside as merely Karp’s attempt to talk his own book—which, for the most part, it is. Harris, in her D.N.C. speech, promised that America would have the “strongest, most lethal fighting force,” and presumably Palantir would have continued to thrive as one of Silicon Valley’s few defense contractors. Harris’s loss, as it turns out, was Karp’s gain. This is true in a banal financial way: compared with its average price during the Biden Administration, Palantir’s stock has appreciated nearly six hundred per cent. It is more interestingly true on the plane of ideas.\n\nMusk’s response to a coddled rank and file has been a purge. When he took over Twitter, he sent a company-wide e-mail that presented a “fork in the road,” as he put it: serve at his pleasure or find another job. The point was not to improve Twitter’s performance. It was to remind his employees of their fungibility. One of his first acts under the auspices of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency was a government-wide e-mail with a buyout offer. The subject line, lest there be any doubt as to its authorship, was “Fork in the Road.” Karp has a different attitude. Silicon Valley is not proof of concept for monarchy. It is proof of concept for war.\n\nSilicon Valley has, or used to have, a special culture. It did not emerge in defiance of the government but as a cornerstone of the modern national project. Federal support for technological development was financial, of course, but Karp thinks this understates its monumental significance. The military-industrial complex was a kind of spiritual investment, a flame that swept through the research community and welded it together. The corporate laborers of the industrial age were drudges, and might have needed the scaffolding of managerial hierarchies to make widgets in bulk. The scientists and engineers of the electronic age, in contrast, did not respond well to top-down instruction. They responded well to meaningful challenges. They could be thrown into a room, or into the desert, with only two parameters: a hard problem to solve and a good reason to solve it. The main problem to solve was defense, and the best reasons to solve it were to secure liberty and prosperity for all.\n\nThis inspired the invention of actual objects, such as bombs, but it also inspired the invention of new processes—the languages of control theory and cybernetics—that in turn became novel experiments in social organization. Scientists and engineers arranged themselves in nested feedback loops; they were quick to criticize, and even quicker to forgive. They weren’t Randian jerks who believed in domination. They believed in the kind of grace that comes from a shared conviction in the civic purpose of their work. The campuses that came to life between San Francisco and San Jose were “a form of modern-day artistic colony, or technological commune,” Karp and Zamiska write, and these campuses recruited “a generation of talent that wanted to do something other than tinker with financial markets or consult.”\n\nThe book’s account of tech culture’s origins is rosy and coarse—the ChatGPT version of Fred Turner’s classic “From Counterculture to Cyberculture”—but it’s a useful corrective to the fantasy that Musk sprung fully formed from the head of Zeus. The notion that these companies were sovereign enclaves of pitilessly despotic geniuses is a myth of recent vintage. Even more belated is the idea that Musk might summon an army of coder-ephebes and rescue us from an inertial government. Going around and breaking things, the authors of “The Technological Republic” think, is not going to breathe new life into our collective endeavors. The government must instead be strong enough to identify what it needs, make an unapologetic case for why, and then provide aspiring venders with a normal demand signal—not four thousand pages of arcane pre-specifications. In the absence of organized government demand, companies will turn to the consumer market instead. And the consumer market should not be the arbiter of value. “The grandiose rallying cry of a generation of founders in Silicon Valley was simply to build,” Karp and Zamiska write. “Few asked what needed to be built, and why.” The tech industry must meet the government halfway by reassessing its own priorities. The national interest is a noble pursuit. Games for your phone are not.\n\nThe book is good as a diagnosis of this phenomenon—the tendency to churn out “derivative and retrograde” products under the guise of innovation. It is even better as an exemplification of it. It reads like an automated Spotify playlist of the greatest hits of national decline. Even its chapter titles (“The Hollowing Out of the American Mind”) have the optimized ring of a recommendation engine: If you liked Allan Bloom and Jonathan Haidt, you’ll like this. The “soul of the country” has been “abandoned in the name of inclusivity,” and “unironic belief in something greater—in many corporate boardrooms and certainly the halls of our most selective colleges and universities—is looked down upon as essentially preindustrial and retrograde.” Karp goes out of his way to identify as a liberal, but the only liberal mentioned in “The Technological Republic” is the communitarian philosopher Michael Sandel. The book’s touchstones are instead an algorithmic procession of disgruntled conservatives: Roger Scruton, Roger Kimball, Irving Kristol, Leo Strauss, Niall Ferguson, and Peggy Noonan.\n\nThe repackaging of old grievances feels like a missed opportunity. There is a growing bipartisan consensus that American innovation has lost the plot. To blame a lack of ambition, or a culture of decline, is merely to re-state the problem. To attribute the corrosion of institutional trust to such bugbears as relativism or postmodernism is to ignore explanations that are both more concrete and more parsimonious. The military-industrial complex did not lose its lustre because Americans were taught that all cultures are equally valid, or because sincerity as such went out of style. The military-industrial complex lost its lustre when it embarked on a series of pointless and destructive wars. Our institutions were damaged by things that we did. They cannot be repaired with an appeal to remember who we are.\n\nKarp seems to be operating under the impression that what Americans need is permission to feel patriotic again. His doctoral dissertation—“Aggression in the Life-World: The Expansion of the Parsonian Concept of Aggression Through the Description of the Connection Between Jargon, Aggression, and Culture”—culminates in an interpretation of the German writer Martin Walser’s acceptance speech upon receipt of the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade in 1998. Walser notoriously described Auschwitz as a “moral cudgel” used to enforce a sense of perennial shame. His claims to victimhood, Karp pointed out, were empirically untrue but extraordinarily effective. His lecture recognized and channelled his audience’s feelings of unconscious aggression and resentment. Germans just wanted to feel proud again, and Walser gave them a warrant to do so.\n\n“The Technological Republic” also invokes this episode, but with Walser now as soothsayer. Germany’s perpetual inability to slough off the sins of its past and simply get on with it, the book stipulates, has had serious repercussions: “An intense skepticism of German identity, of allowing any sense of the nation to take hold in the wreckage of the war, has had significant costs and deprived the continent of a credible deterrent to Russian aggression.”\n\nAmericans, too, suffer from a deficit of national pride. In some progressive circles, the reëlection of Trump has confirmed the suspicion that “we” are beyond redemption, and that liberals were delusional when they spoke of our democratic experiment in terms of moral progress. “The Technological Republic” presents an alternative case in favor of a healthy self-image, one that relies on our steady accumulation of know-how. In its better moments, the book advances the notion that technological progress, and the hope for the future it represents, might put the national project on a secure footing.\n\nKarp identifies his faith in our engineering prowess with the American tradition of pragmatism; in the span of only three pages, “The Technological Republic” calls for a “voracious pragmatism,” a “ruthless pragmatism,” and a “ravenous pragmatism.” The pragmatist tradition does, in fact, have a lot to say about the relationships between loyalty, prosperity, and bloodshed. In 1910, William James, one of the founders of our national philosophy, wrote an essay titled “The Moral Equivalent of War.” Combat, he acknowledged, had long been recognized as “the gory nurse that trained societies to cohesiveness.” It was “a sort of sacrament.” The sacrifices of war were the Nietzschean wages of heroism: “Its ‘horrors’ are a cheap price to pay for rescue from the only alternative supposed, of a world of clerks and teachers, of co-education and zo-ophily, of ‘consumer’s leagues’ and ‘associated charities,’ of industrialism unlimited, and feminism unabashed. No scorn, no hardness, no valor any more!”\n\nA hearty society, James agreed, could not get along without the martial virtues of discipline, focus, interdependence, and “intrepidity.” Actual war might have been a sufficient condition for the cultivation of these values, but it was not a necessary one. James proposed that the nation’s youths pay their “blood-tax” in the form of a national-service program that would redound to our universal benefit. Rich and poor kids alike would put on hardhats and erect skyscrapers or build dams. The national community could be knit together without indulging the chauvinism of belligerence. This did not immunize his fellow-pragmatists from the seductions of a fight. Only a few years later, John Dewey came out in support of American intervention against Prussian militarism, imagining that, in a two-birds-one-stone way, the war effort could also promote social reform. His former student Randolph Bourne accused him of capitulation to the cheap thrills of nationalist fervor, to the premise that “war is the health of the state.” Karp approvingly quotes a line of Dewey’s from 1922: one must “get down from noble aloofness into the muddy stream of concrete things.”\n\nYet Dewey, by then, already regretted his enthusiasm for a war that brought only mass suffering and death abroad and the suppression of civil liberties at home. He had belatedly learned Bourne’s lesson about the temptation to kill two birds with one stone: it unleashes forces that do not submit to pragmatic control. Karp maintains his confidence in war as the great dual-use technology, and the book relies on circular logic: national security is supposed to inspire national pride, but national pride is apparently the precondition for national security.\n\nThe pragmatic strain of “The Technological Republic” raises the genuinely strategic matter of how we might prepare for a battlefield suffused with advanced artificial intelligence: “The broader question we face is not whether a new generation of increasingly autonomous weapons incorporating artificial intelligence will be built. It is who will build them and for what purpose.” This seems like something to be taken seriously, and perhaps Palantir is planning in earnest. The other strain of the book abandons strategic pragmatism in favor of metaphysical grandeur: “The generation that is most capable and best positioned to construct this next wave of offensive capabilities is also the most content to retreat from projects involving national defense or communal purpose.” This task—which involves defining the national purpose—would also seem to be something to be taken seriously, but it’s probably not one we should entrust to Palantir. ♦",

    "content": "# These Companies—Palantir, AT&T, Deloitte—Have The Biggest ICE Contracts As DHS Funding Under Fire\n\nByTy Roush,\n\nForbes Staff.\n\n## Topline\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement has come under fire after a second person was killed by federal agents in Minneapolis, with protesters demanding an end to additional federal funding ahead of a possible government shutdown centered around the funding dispute, though backlash may extend to the hundreds of companies that have been awarded contracts with the agency in recent years.\n\n## Key Facts\n\nPalantir: The tech and analytics software provider was awarded $139.3 million in 2022 to assist “investigative case management operations,” maintenance support and “custom enhancements.”\n\nAT&T: The telecommunications giant was awarded $90.7 million in 2021 to provide ICE with IT, network products and support in a contract set to expire in September, though it includes a potential end date of 2032 that could push the deal’s value to $165.2 million\n\nDeloitte: ICE has awarded the consulting firm several multiyear contracts in recent years, including a $24 million contract in 2023 to provide “data modernization support” through 2027.\n\nDell: The company’s government contracting arm was awarded $18.8 million in April 2025 to support the office of ICE’s chief information officer “through the purchase of the Microsoft Enterprise software licenses.”\n\nMotorola Solutions: A separate firm from the cell phone maker Motorola Mobility that produces walkie-talkies and video surveillance systems, Motorola Solutions was awarded a $15.6 million contract in September 2023 to “implement and maintain” ICE’s tactical communication infrastructure.\n\nGeneral Dynamics: The defense firm holds a $9.6 million contract with ICE to provide “background investigative services.”\n\nL3 Harris: Defense contractor L3 Harris was awarded a $4.4 million contract with ICE in 2022 to provide equipment to “determine the location of targeted mobile handsets to investigate crimes and threats.”\n\nFedEx: The mail carrier provides delivery services for ICE through March 2027 in a contract valued at $2.3 million.\n\nComcast: The company holds an ICE award valued at $60,965.64 to provide the agency with broadcast cable at five “regional wire rooms.”\n\nCharter Communications: The company provides cable and internet services for ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations field office in Beaumont, Texas, in a contract valued at $12,837, which may expand to $21,839 and extend until 2028.\n\n## News Peg\n\nSenate Democrats discussed on Sunday blocking a Department of Homeland Security funding bill, with many citing ICE’s immigration crackdown. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., wrote on X he “cannot and will not vote” to fund Homeland Security “while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities.” The government could shut down shortly after midnight Saturday should the package fail to reach the required 60 votes. Prediction market Kalshi shows odds of a government shutdown around 77%—up from less than 10% shortly before the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by Border Patrol in Minneapolis this weekend.\n\n## Surprising Fact\n\nManagement consultancy firm McKinsey & Company said in July 2018 it would stop work for ICE after disclosing it had done $20 million in consulting work for the agency. The disclosure reportedly sparked protests among current and former employees who opposed immigration policies during President Donald Trump’s first term. Employees at Microsoft similarly protested the company’s $19.4 million contract with ICE, though Microsoft never disclosed whether it cut ties with the agency (CEO Satya Nadella said in 2018 the company provided cloud support for ICE and called Trump’s immigration policies at the time “simply cruel and abusive.”). Last week, more than 250 employees at several tech giants—including Amazon, Palantir, Spotify, Google and Tesla, among others—demanded their employers to speak publicly against ICE, “call the White House and demand that ICE leave our cities” and to cancel all company contracts with the agency. It’s not immediately clear whether some of the companies hold contracts with ICE.\n\n## Key Background\n\nTens of thousands of people have marched in Minneapolis in recent days, calling for ICE to leave Minnesota and to hold officials legally accountable for the deaths of Pretti and Renee Good, who were shot and killed by federal agents amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Trump and his allies have pointed to Pretti and Good for the shootings, claiming both were “domestic terrorists.” Pretti had a concealed carry license and was legally carrying a firearm, though video footage shows he never drew the weapon, which appeared to be removed by law enforcement before he was shot. The administration’s claim that Good was trying to weaponize her vehicle to run over a federal agent also does not appear to be backed by publicly available video evidence.\n\n## Tangent\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced Monday the agency would cancel all contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton, valued at roughly $4.8 million annually. Bessent cited former Booz Allen contractor Charles Littlejohn, who was sentenced to five years in federal prison for leaking President Donald Trump’s tax returns in 2024, arguing the company did not have “adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data.”\n\n## Further Reading",

Now he’s entering the culture-war debate and changing it to a capital-markets moment.\n\nThe **[Palantir](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/PLTR) ([PLTR](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/PLTR))** CEO believes the issue of large-scale immigration will become irrelevant moving forward, [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2026/01/20/palantir-ceo-ai-humanities-jobs-davos-alex-karp/) reported.\n\n> There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation.\n\nAlex Karp\n\nPalantir CEO, at World Economic Forum in Davos\n\nKeep Watching\n\nHow to register for a $1,000 Trump account when you file your taxes\n\nKarp believes a need for future **large-scale immigration** is “hard to imagine,” except for people with very specialized skills essential to a company such as Palantir. His comment clearly blasts a hole in the culture-war issue.\n\nNow, it isn’t my first rodeo covering Palantir, and I see things purely from a financial perspective. High-end, white-collar employees are responsible for a large chunk of expenses for every major large-cap company.\n\nThe bottom line is that Palantir isn’t a think tank; it’s a stock. The market is pricing it like a megacap inevitability.\n\nPalantir shares are up **more than 130%** over the prior 12 months, pushing its value to about **$400 billion**.\n\nAre you starting to see what this can mean? Pain on Main Street, power on [Wall Street](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/w/wall-street).\n\n![Image 28: CEO of Palantir Technologies Alex Karp](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/w_3840,q_auto:good,c_limit/NDA6MDAwMDAwMDAyODU3NjE2/ceo-of-palantir-technologies-alex-karp-attends-the-pennsylvania-energy-and-innovation-summit-on-the-campus-of-carnegie-mellon-university-in-pittsburgh-pennsylvania-on-july-15-2025-photo-by-andrew-cab.jpg?arena_f_auto)\n\n_Alex Karp just lit a match under the immigration debate._ — Source: [Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/of-palantir-technologies-alex-karp-attends-the-pennsylvania-news-photo/2224614234)\n\nPalantir quick facts at a glance\n--------------------------------\n\n*   **Last stock price:** about **$169.60**\n*   **12-month run:****+130%**\n*   **Market value:** about **$400B**\n*   **Next earnings date:****Feb. 2, 2026**\n\nTheStreet Newsletters\n\nGet the latest in market trends or guidance on simple ways to grow your wealth.\n\n- [x] TheStreet Daily \n\n- [x] Filthy Rich Animal \n\nSign up\n\nor sign in with\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nMicrosoft\n\nApple\n\nBy signing up I agree to the [Terms of Use](https://thearenagroup.net/terms-of-use/) and acknowledge that I have read the [Privacy Policy](https://thearenagroup.net/privacy-policy/). You may unsubscribe from email communication at anytime.\n\nWhy Karp’s take on immigration matters to investors\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nKarp’s comment isn’t just about politics; it’s also a matter of branding.\n\nKarp’s argument regarding the job market is that Palantir’s software is at the core of a future in which businesses and governments need to accomplish more with fewer people.\n\nThat story may help a company keep its premium, but it may also increase headline risk. This is particularly true for Palantir, which has worked with U.S. immigration officials in the past and is often in the news for political reasons.\n\nWhen a corporation already has a “priced for perfection” aura, political instability doesn’t have to be “material” to be important. It just has to be loud.\n\nThe H-1B cost math: what corporate America actually pays\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf Alex Karp says [AI](https://www.thestreet.com/tag/artificial-intelligence) makes large-scale immigration “hard to imagine,” it’s important to remember that corporate America usually talks about the [spreadsheet first](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations/h-1b-cap-season), not ideology.\n\nFor a typical large employer filing a **new cap-subject H-1B**, employer spending is best thought of in **two buckets**: **(1) government fees** and **(2) legal/compliance costs**, which bleeds into the debate Karp is discussing.\n\n[View post: Samsung drops Galaxy S26 Ultra bombshell](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/samsung-drops-galaxy-s26-ultra-bombshell)![Image 29](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/w_3840,q_auto:good,c_fill,ar_1:1/NDA6MDAwMDAwMDAyODU2ODAy/an-attendee-holds-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-smartphones-during-a-media-event-ahead-of-galaxy-unpacked-at-the-brooklyn-navy-yard-in-new-york-us-on-monday-july-7-2025-samsung-electronics-co-unveiled-two-u.jpg?arena_f_auto)\n\nInvesting\n\n[Samsung drops Galaxy S26 Ultra bombshell](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/samsung-drops-galaxy-s26-ultra-bombshell)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the surface, it’s business as usual. Behind the curtain, it’s not.\n\nFaizan Farooque\n\n0 \n\n*   [AAPL](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/AAPL)\n*   [SSNLF](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/SSNLF)\n\n**Common government fees for hiring non U.S.-citizen employees (typical large employer):**\n\n*   **$215**[registration fee](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/fy-2026-h-1b-cap-initial-registration-period-opens-on-march-7)\n*   **$780** Form I-129 H-1B filing fee (for many employers)\n*   **$600** Asylum Program Fee (for many employers)\n*   **$750 or $1,500**[ACWIA training fee](https://www.uscis.gov/archive/frequently-asked-questions-on-the-uscis-fee-rule) (depends on employer size; not owed for certain same-employer extensions)\n*   **$500** fraud fee in specified filing situations\n*   [**$4,000** Public Law 114-113 fee](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/forms/g-1055.pdf) for a subset of employers\n\n**Option to expedite the hiring process:**\n\n*   Premium processing is set to rise to **$2,965 effective March 1, 2026** (up from **$2,805**).\n\nLegal/compliance is the multiplier. Lawyers often charge a few thousand dollars for each case, and the time spent by internal HR and compliance staff adds a lot to the cost.\n\nSo why not eliminate it altogether? That is what Palantir’s CEO is talking about.\n\n**Scale marker (this is why it adds up quickly):**\n\n*   USCIS approved about **399,395 H-1B petitions** in FY2024.\n    *   **141,205 initial**\n    *   **258,190 ongoing**\n\nWhen you add up all the government fines and “low-thousands” legal fees, the total cost to businesses across the economy is usually in the low single-digit billions of dollars each year.\n\nThe numbers that make Palantir’s bull case seem real\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nTo support Palantir’s value, it’s important to remember what the company has done and is still doing.\n\nThis has nothing to do with the immigration debate.\n\nIn its earnings report for the third quarter of 2025, which it sent to the [SEC](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/s/securities-exchange-commission), Palantir reported the following.\n\n*   **Revenue: [$1.181 billion](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2025/Palantir-Reports-Q3-2025-U-S--Comm-Revenue-Growth-of-121-YY-and-Revenue-Growth-of-63-YY-Guides-Q4-Revenue-to-61-YY-and-U-S--Comm-Revenue-to-121-YY-Raises-FY-2025-Revenue-Guidance-to-53-YY-Crushing-Consensus-Expectations/)** (up **63%** from last year)\n*   **GAAP net income**: **$476 million** (**40%** margin)\n*   **GAAP [operating income](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/o/operating-income)**: **$393 million**, which is a 33% profit margin\n*   **Adjusted income from operations:****$601M**, or **51%** of sales\n*   **Adjusted [free cash flow](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/f/free-cash-flow-fcf): $540 million** (**46%** margin)\n*   **$6.4B** in **cash, equivalents, and short-term Treasuries**\n*   **GAAP EPS** of **$0.18**, and adjusted EPS of $0.21\n\nThese aren’t “small-cap software” margins; they’re the kind of margins that help investors understand a price that makes traditional “cheap/expensive” arguments seem pointless.\n\nUntil the first mistake.\n\nThis is where I propose a different point of view. Palantir’s comments will definitely have a major impact on the future of both immigration and business.\n\n**More Palantir**\n\n*   [**Bank of America updates Palantir stock forecast after private meeting**](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/bank-of-america-updates-palantir-stock-forecast-after-private-meeting)\n*   [**US Navy bets $448M on Palantir AI to speed shipbuilding**](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/pentagon-gave-palantir-448-million-learn-why)\n*   [**Palantir secures quiet contract win with big implications**](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/palantir-secures-quiet-contract-win-with-big-implications)\n*   [**Michael Burry shares bold predictions for OpenAI, Palantir**](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/michael-burry-shares-bold-predictions-for-openai-palantir)\n\nBut right now, PLTR stockholders want the AI company to explain why its stock is so high, to keep growing, and to stay out of political arguments that are hard to resolve.\n\nOn the other hand, commercial revenue is rising, which means Palantir will seem less like a corporate face of the immigration debate and more like a real AI analytics company that wants to change how corporate America does business.\n\nU.S. commercial deal momentum is what Wall Street keeps talking about\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPalantir’s Q3 statement shows that the company is still going strong with its transaction data.\n\n*   The total value of closed contracts was **$2.76 billion**, which is **151%** more than last year.\n*   The [U.S. commercial TCV closed at **$1.31 billion**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000132165525000130/a2025q3ex991earningsrelease.htm), a **342%** increase from the previous year.\n*   The remaining deal value for U.S. businesses is **$3.63 billion**, which is up **199%** from last year and 30% from last quarter.\n*   Customer count is up **45%** from last year (and up **7%** from last quarter).\n\nThe bulls call that RDV number “future revenue already under the hood.”\n\nSkeptics also see this as a warning that the market expects today’s pipeline to become tomorrow’s acceleration, not tomorrow’s digestion.\n\nHD Hyundai and “30% faster” shipbuilding\n----------------------------------------\n\nPalantir didn’t just talk at Davos this week.\n\nPalantir and [HD](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/HD) Hyundai’s [expanded deal](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2026/HD-Hyundai-and-Palantir-Expand-Group-Wide-Strategic-Partnership/) is worth hundreds of millions of dollars over a number of years and covers the whole company.\n\nHyundai says that using Palantir software to speed up work has helped it build ships about 30% faster.\n\nThis is why Karp keeps pushing “vocational workers” and “real industry” rather than simple office-work automation, integrating Palantir to hard productivity outcomes, not just dashboards.\n\nWhat to watch before Palantir’s next earnings report\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nHere’s a quick list to check off before February 2.\n\n*   **Guidance**: Does Palantir win again, or does it “meet” and move on?\n*   **U.S. commercial RDV**: Does **$3.63B** keep climbing at rates of three digits?\n*   **Cash flow**: Is it possible for Palantir to continue making **$540 million** in adjusted FCF-type numbers every quarter while it grows?\n*   Karp is choosing to get into big public fights, which is a **headline risk** for investors.\n\nIn the end, despite cultural conversation surrounding Karp’s immigration line in Davos, math will decide Palantir’s stock.\n\nBut remember: Sometimes the line between these can blur.\n\n[View post: Bank of America drops bold call on Roblox,

    "content": "Deadly ICE raids in the US rely on Palantir tools that mine health records to produce real-time data on people’s location – a chilling prospect for the NHS\n\nAs the world watches the deadly US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in horror, Palantir is cashing in. Masked agents are using the firm’s app, Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement (ELITE), to pinpoint people for deportation, and they’re using addresses from medical records to do it.\n\nAccording to a user guide [obtained by 404 Media](https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/), the app uses address information from the Department of Health and Human Services, US Citizenship and Immigration Services and other sources to “improve capabilities for identifying and prioritizing high-value targets through advanced analytics”. The app “brings up a dossier on each person” and “provides a confidence score on the person’s current address”. As one ICE officer revealed in court, ELITE “tells you how many people are living in this area and what’s the likelihood of them actually being there”.\n\nThis isn’t the first time we’ve seen Palantir use dystopian predictive technology. In February last year, the firm won contracts to develop a surveillance network in the UK, flagging people [“about to commit a criminal offence”](https://libertyinvestigates.org.uk/articles/uk-police-working-with-controversial-tech-giant-palantir-on-real-time-surveillance-network/). But predictive models depend on past data, which risks [entrenching existing bias](https://www.stop-watch.org/news-opinion/privatising-the-algorithm-when-predictive-policing-moves-beyond-the-state).\n\nIs your local NHS Trust using Palantir’s software?[Find out now](https://notopalantir.goodlawproject.org/email-to-target/stop-palantir-in-the-nhs/)\n\nThe spy firm [bagged a £240m contract](https://www.politico.eu/article/palantir-lands-biggest-ever-uk-defense-deal/) with the Ministry of Defence earlier this month, supplying data analytics to support “[critical strategic, tactical and live operational decision making](https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Notice/083874-2025)”.\n\nWhile the UK gets further enmeshed with the Silicon Valley giant, the Swiss government has rejected Palantir. An internal Swiss army report raised concerns that US government and intelligence services could access sensitive data. As the Labour MP Clive Lewis [told the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/22/mps-question-uk-palantir-contracts-security-concerns-investigation), “the Swiss army is right to be suspicious”.\n\n“Palantir … is an organisation that the British government, in terms of the NHS, in terms of contracts, should stay very far away from,” Lewis said.\n\nBut [Palantir’s questionable ethics](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/04/palantir-ipo-ice-immigration-trump-administration) were clear from the start. And in February 2025, Palantir’s CEO, [Alex Karp said](https://www.ft.com/content/64a2345e-3961-4d5d-ae04-82d933fa5a2c) “I love the idea of getting a drone and having light fentanyl-laced urine spraying on analysts that tried to screw us.”\n\nPalantir’s infiltration into the British government is chilling. A world where our health records are used to power state-sponsored surveillance and target vulnerable communities isn’t so far away. With NHS England currently rolling out software to run our health records from Palantir,  and Nigel Farage riding high in the polls, this terrifying possibility risks becoming an inevitability.\n\nIt’s time to push back to ensure this spy tech giant can never turn our private medical histories into tools.\n\nPalantir did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n-   [Say no to Palantir – take action now.](https://notopalantir.goodlawproject.org/email-to-target/stop-palantir-in-the-nhs/)",

    "content": "The Green Party leader has today delivered a notice of contract termination to Palantir which has a seven year £330m contract with the NHS to build FDP, the ‘NHS Federated Data Platform’ to link and manage patient data.\n\nGreen Party leader Zack Polanski said:\n\n“I have today handed a letter to Palantir serving it notice to pack its bags and get the hell out of the NHS.\n\n“This Trump supporting military surveillance outfit has no place in Britain’s most important institution. The NHS cares for patients and brings our country together. Palantir’s most recent history is to actively aid and abet genocide in Gaza and to provide surveillance data for Trump’s paramilitary ICE squads, currently causing death and mayhem on the streets of America.\n\n“When Wes Streeting can take some time out from meeting his private health donors, he should cancel this contract right now. If he doesn’t, my letter today to Palantir makes clear we will use every method at our disposal to force them out. Doctors have made clear they do not trust Palantir with patients’ private data, and with its appalling track record, I am with the doctors”.\n\nThere will be a review of the contract in 2027, with the UK government’s Contracts Finder database showing a formal contract end date of 15 February 2027 – so the government could end it then.\n\nThe contract was awarded by NHS England in 2023 by the Conservative Government. Palantir is also known to have close links to the Labour government, and it has been reported that the corporation hired Peter Mandelson to lobby the Labour Government to help them win more government contracts.\n\nPalantir is an American technology company that specialises in artificial intelligence powered military and surveillance technology and data analytics and was founded by the Trump donor Peter Thiel.\n\nThe BMA last year passed a formal resolution calling for the Palantir NHS contract to be cancelled saying it, “threatens to undermine public trust in NHS data systems” and is unclear how the sensitive patient data would be processed by Palantir, citing the firm’s track record of creating discriminatory policing software in the US” and its “close links to a US government which shows little regard for international law”.\n\nThe Government has mandated providers and Integrated Care Boards to Palantir’s Federated Data Platform (FDP) to ‘start making use of core products, data capabilities and population health management tools by 2028/29, according to the Medium Term Planning Framework published by the Department of Health.\n\nHowever, according to NHS figures, fewer than a quarter of England’s 215 hospital trusts were actively using FDP by the end of 2024. Some Trust’s are on record as questioning its functionality and purpose.\n\nZack Polanski’s letter to Palantir CEO Alex Karp:\n\nDear Alex,\n\nI am today putting you on notice that the Green Party of England and Wales is calling for your contract with the NHS to be cancelled.\n\nWe object to your involvement in the NHS on three main grounds:\n\n1. We do not trust you with the use of people’s health data. Your track record around the world of surveillance and discriminatory use of data contributing to abuses and genocide means we don’t believe you a fit partner for the NHS, an institution that has served this country with distinction since 1948.\n\n1. You have actively aided the genocide in Gaza. In January 2024, you signed a deal with the IDF to increase its “advanced technology provision” to Israel in support of war related missions. You have said that you are “exceedingly proud” of Palantir’s involvement in what you called “operationally crucial in Israel.” The UN special rapporteur on human rights identified Palantir as complicit in war crimes and “profiting from genocide” in Gaza.\n\n1. It has been reported that you are working on a tool for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a “confidence score” on the person’s current address. We are strongly of the view that ICE is acting like a personalised paramilitary police force to Donald Trump, and recently shot dead Renee Good in cold blood. We stand in solidarity with her.\n\nFurther, I know that companies such as yours hire corporate lobbyists such as Peter Mandelson to assess ‘political risk’. I have some advice you can have for free. The political risk is very high for your continuing involvement with the NHS. The Green Party is advancing, and we will use every means at our disposal, including that of our many thousands of members to get you out of the NHS. We will form alliances with like-minded campaigners and MPs, of all parties, so that the pressure on the Government to cancel your NHS contract becomes too great. Whatever happens at the next general election, we will use whatever influence we have to insist on your removal from the NHS.\n\nMy understanding is that there is real hesitation among hospital trusts and Integrated Care Boards to use your platform, and from my conversations with people in the NHS, they don’t believe it offers anything they can’t already access, and that it has little to no impact on patient care or reducing waiting times for treatment.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nZack Polanski, Leader of the Green Party in England and Wales\n\nThe Green Party objects to the use of Palantir on three main grounds:\n\n1. We do not trust Palantir and the Labour Government with the use of people’s health data. Aside from Palantir’s own disgraceful role in the genocide in Gaza, we also note the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood recently told the Tony Blair Institute that she wanted to use AI and surveillance data so that ‘the eyes of the state can be on you at all times’. The Labour Government is persistently pursing authoritarian policies, including prescribing Palestine Action, abolishing jury trials and attempting to introduce digital ID.\n\n1.

    "content": "# Palantir CEO claims AI will mean western economies won't need immigration\n\n## Alex Karp can sniff out a hot potato topic, but what comes next in the act?\n\nOpinion Palantir CEO Alex Karp has an inimitable aptitude for sniffing out the politically sensitive topic about which, by his own admission, he should not be speaking, but which will also win him the most attention.\n\nLast year, it was the idea of innate western superiority and his belief that his company's software product was \"the only reason why someone's not goose-stepping between me and you\" on the streets of Europe.\n\nThis week, after promising not to go on one of his \"usual political screeds,\" the Palantir CEO went off on one, as the Brits like to say, launching into a speculative analysis of the impact of AI on immigration. Two hot topics in one: bingo.\n\nFlying into Davos for the World Economic Forum — or perhaps appearing in a puff of red smoke from under a ghoulish cloak — Karp responded to probing about the impact of AI on the jobs market.\n\n\"I do think these trends [in AI] really do make it hard to imagine why we should have large-scale immigration unless you have a very specialized skill,\" he said.\n\nHe was unlikely to have his worldview significantly challenged by his interviewer, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the septuagenarian billionaire Co-Chairman of the World Economic Forum.\n\nAnd so it proved, with Fink gliding past the notion that many immigrants fulfil roles in health, construction, or service industry jobs that western nations find hard to fill, and focusing on the important point for attendees: the impact on white-collar jobs.\n\nThe point is not without merit: 4.7 million non-US-born workers fulfil professional and business services roles, for example.\n\nDuring the World Economic Forum session, Karp agreed that AI would lead to fewer white collar jobs. But went on to say that organizations \"need different ways of testing aptitude.\"\n\n## Palantir boss says outfit's software the only reason the 'goose step' has not returned to Europe\n\n\"There are a lot of people doing X that should be doing Y,\" he said, adding that one of his main tasks at the US-based spy-tech company was \"walking around figuring out what is someone's outlier aptitude.\"\n\nOutside the febrile atmosphere of the WEF Annual Meeting, skeptics on the actual benefits of AI are becoming more commonplace.\n\nYesterday, Deutsche Bank analysts Adrian Cox and Stefan Abrudan published a note declaring the \"the honeymoon is over\" for AI. The AI market will be hit by disillusionment, dislocation, and distrust, they said. \"This matters as AI investment and optimism are buoying the global economy, accounting for most of economic and earnings growth in the US last year,\" they said, suggesting the consequences should the AI boom go into reverse.\n\nThe sentiment echoed earlier comments from Gartner, which said enterprise adoption of AI was in the so-called \"trough of disillusionment,\" while investment from AI, cloud, and software companies was still sky-rocketing. Meanwhile, the majority of CEOs are reporting zero pay-offs from AI investments, according to PwC.\n\n- British Palantir rival, whose founder touted UK tech sovereignty, sells to Accenture\n- UK urged to unplug from US tech giants as digital sovereignty fears grow\n- Repent ye inefficient – the 'Palantir-ization' of IT services is upon us\n- US gov't launches 'Tech Force' to replace IT staff DOGE fired\n\nKarp admitted AI is a \"very low-trust environment,\" which is why Palantir needs very few salespeople.\n\nIn the case of building AI systems, he said, \"people have tried lots of stuff. A lot of it hasn't worked. But if [like Palantir] you've delivered stuff that does work, why do you need a salesforce?\"\n\nOf course, in the conversation about AI and the future of work in the western world, Karp found room to claim Palantir's enterprise projects can save \"80 percent of your cost and improve your top line dramatically.\"\n\nPerhaps the question is really, when you have Alex Karp, why do you need a salesforce? He admitted he got pressure from inside Palantir saying he \"should stop speaking in public,\" but that's all part of the schtick. Because, notwithstanding the chronic verbal diarrhea, his outlier aptitude is undoubtedly making himself and his company the center of attention. It's a shame we will all smell the consequences when the winds change. ®\n\n- AI\n- Palantir\n\n### More about\n\n- AI\n- Palantir\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n- AIOps\n- DeepSeek\n- Gemini\n- Google AI\n- GPT-3\n- GPT-4\n- Large Language Model\n- Machine Learning\n- MCubed\n- Neural Networks\n- NLP\n- Retrieval Augmented Generation\n- Star Wars\n- Tensor Processing Unit\n- TOPS\n\n### Broader topics\n\n- Self-driving Car\n\n- AI\n- Palantir\n\n### More about\n\n- AI\n- Palantir\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n- AIOps\n- DeepSeek\n- Gemini\n- Google AI\n- GPT-3\n- GPT-4\n- Large Language Model\n- Machine Learning\n- MCubed\n- Neural Networks\n- NLP\n- Retrieval Augmented Generation\n- Star Wars\n- Tensor Processing Unit\n- TOPS\n\n### Broader topics\n\n- Self-driving Car\n\nSend us news",

And so the intake flow and into your enterprise in a way that you can actually process these things 10, 15 times faster than you could before,\" Karp said. \"It saves a lot of lives.\"\n\n\"Despite what people may want to believe, it also bolsters civil liberties, because now you can see, well, I mean, just simple questions — Was someone processed based on economic considerations, or were they processed based on their background? Like those things are impossible to see, unless you have, like, there's a huge civil liberties betterment side of this that typically people don't believe we care about or, but it's actually exactly the opposite,\" he continued.\n\nSERVICENOW PARTNERS WITH OPENAI IN THREE-YEAR PUSH TO TRANSFORM ENTERPRISE AI\n\nPalantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp attends the 56th annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026.

It's like we can granularly show why someone came in, why they were taken, why they were rejected, and we can do it in a way that makes business sense for the business itself,\" Karp said.\n\nWhen asked by Fink if AI is going to create a greater imbalance in the world in terms of growth, Karp said, \"Well, I think the obvious first imbalance is, it seems like America and China understand versions of making this work, and they're different, but they both work, and they work at scale, and I think that is very likely to accelerate way beyond what most people believe is possible.\"\n\n\"Like the discount rate, I think, not in the short term, but in the long term is way too high on what will be done and how this will impact every aspect of our society,\" Karp added.\n\nHe also said: \"The tech adoption in Europe is a serious and very, very structural problem, and what scares me the most is, I haven't seen any political leader just stand up and say we have a serious and structural problem that we are going to fix.\"\n\nAI RAISES AVERAGE WAGES BY 21% AND SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES’ WAGE INEQUALITY, RESEARCHERS FIND\n\nAlex Karp, chief executive officer of Palantir Technologies Inc., during the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026. (Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg via / Getty Images)\n\nWhen asked if he thought AI was going to create or destroy jobs overall, Karp said, \"I think one of the unfortunate things of the narrative in the West is, it will destroy humanities jobs.\"\n\n\"But like technicians. If you are a vocational technician. Or, like, we're building batteries for a battery company and the people who are doing it in America are doing roughly the same job that Japanese engineers are doing, and they went to high school,\" he continued. \"And now, they're very valuable, if not irreplaceable, because we can make them into something different than what they were, very rapidly.

Pay so everyone can!\n\n# “We kill enemies”: Spy firm Palantir secures top Australian security clearance\n\nby Stephanie Tran | Jan 19, 2026 | Government, Latest Posts\n\nPalantir image: Camillia Bradley\n\nCybersecurity company Palantir has received a high-level Australian government security assessment despite concerns about its surveillance and complicity in the Gaza genocide. Stephanie Tran reports.\n\nIn November 2025, Palantir Technologies was assessed as meeting the protected level under the Australian Information Security Registered Assessors Program (IRAP). This protection is a key requirement for companies seeking to handle sensitive government information.\n\nThe assessment enables a broader range of Australian government agencies and commercial organisations to use Palantir’s Foundry and artificial intelligence platform, AIP.\n\nIn a statement, Palantir said the assessment was conducted by an independent third-party assessor in line with requirements set by the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), and demonstrated its ability to meet “stringent national security and privacy standards”.\n\nThe company described Australia as an “important market”, saying the clearance would open “new opportunities” across the public and private sectors.\n\nAlex Karp, Palantir CEO. Image: palantir.com\n\n### Mass surveillance without accountability\n\nPalantir has been mired in controversy internationally over how its data analysis and AI tools are deployed by government and military clients, with experts warning that the company’s technology enables mass surveillance and data collection with limited accountability.\n\nAn ASD spokesperson stated that IRAP status should\n\n> not be interpreted as government approval or endorsement of a company’s broader conduct or use of data.\n\nnot be interpreted as government approval or endorsement of a company’s broader conduct or use of data.\n\n“IRAP assessments are third-party commercial arrangements between IRAP assessors (or companies offering ‘IRAP assessment’ services) and assessed entities,” an ASD spokesperson said. “ASD does not sign off or approve IRAP assessments.”\n\n### Lobbying push amid political pressure\n\nPalantir’s expanded access to Australian government work comes amid growing political scrutiny. According to reporting by Capital Brief, in July 2025, the company hired lobbying firm CMAX Advisory, after the Greens called for an immediate freeze on government contracts with the company.\n\n> I want to talk to you about Palantir and its expanding footprint in Australia.

We need transparency about what data they’re accessing & why. 🧵 — David Shoebridge (@DavidShoebridge) July 7, 2025\n\nI want to talk to you about Palantir and its expanding footprint in Australia.

An investigation by 404 Media revealed that the company was developing a tool that generates detailed dossiers on potential deportation targets, maps their locations and assigns “confidence scores” to their likely whereabouts.\n\nThe company has also attracted attention in Australia for its work with private sector clients, including Coles, where they were hired to cut costs and “optimise” the company’s workforce.\n\n### “We kill enemies”\n\nKarp has been blunt about Palantir’s mission. Speaking to shareholders and investors last week, he described the company’s purpose as helping the West “scare enemies” and, “on occasion, kill them”.\n\nKarp also joked about “getting a drone and having light fentanyl-laced urine spraying on analysts that tried to screw us”.\n\n### Millions in government contracts\n\nDespite the controversy, Palantir has quietly built a substantial footprint in Australia. According to Austender data, the company has secured more than $50m in Australian government contracts since 2013, largely across defence and national security-related agencies.\n\nThe 2024 financial report of its Australian subsidiary, Palantir Technologies Australia Pty Ltd, show $25.5m in revenue from customer contracts in 2024, though the company’s local financial reports are not audited.\n\nIn 2020, Palantir recommended that the Australian government consider “expanding the exemption from public access to disclosure documents”, arguing that filing financial reports with ASIC “is expensive” and “gives competitors access to confidential information”.\n\n> “Make Iran like Gaza”: Chilling insider view from Israel weapons expo\n\n“Make Iran like Gaza”: Chilling insider view from Israel weapons expo\n\nStephanie is a journalist with a background in both law and journalism.

It expects over $4 billion (CHF3.2 billion) in revenue this year. Many people, however, see it as a symbol of a tech dystopia. The company’s software products aggregate diverse data, using them to create situational pictures.\n\nIts software provides armies with information that influences decisions to kill. The police use it as a surveillance tool. Large companies also use it to optimise processes and support decision-making.\n\nPalantir has customers in the military and administrative sectors the world over. The Swiss government was also on the tech company’s wish list, but no deal ever came to be. The country’s federal agencies and army have so far shied away from cooperation. However, whatever is holding the authorities back appears not to be an obstacle for the organisations promoting Switzerland as a business location for global players.\n\n## A visit to Palantir’s offices in Zurich\n\nAs expected, the tech company declined our initial request for a meeting last July. Palantir has a reputation for being secretive.\n\nTo get an idea of the company firsthand, we decided to pay a call to its address in Zurich. There we encountered a trust company, which turned us away. Shortly afterwards, we were contacted by a law firm, acting on behalf of Palantir, which asked about the purpose of our visit. We again requested a chance to talk.\n\nNot long after, Palantir invited us for a meeting in their actual offices. On arrival, we were greeted by two casually dressed men in trainers who introduced themselves as Alec and Courtney. Alec McShane heads Palantir’s business operations in Europe and is mainly in charge of relations with private clients. Courtney Bowman acts as the the contact person for Swiss media requests. His official title is “global director of privacy and civil liberties engineering”.\n\nPalantir has recently been receiving a particularly large number of enquiries regarding data protection and civil liberties.\n\nDuring our meeting, the two executives acknowledge that the US company has a significant reputation problem in Europe. The company feels misunderstood and not rightly appreciated – for example by the German media.\n\nIndeed, the use of Palantir software by police authorities has been the subject of debate in Germany for months. Critics fear that anyone who simply files charges or is the victim of a crime could come under scrutiny by the authorities because of Palantir. The software scours all data silos like a vacuum cleaner and creates profiles, patterns and analyses.\n\n“Yes, we are under pressure, and this is impacting business,” Bowman says. People have a false perception of the company, he laments, so it needs to readjust its communication strategy.\n\n“This is the reason we invited you here today,” he adds.\n\nThe roughly hour-long meeting is surprisingly open, with the Palantir executives responding to all points of criticism. They are at pains to clear up some “misunderstandings” in this conversation.\n\nOne issue is that the Swiss authorities seem to have serious reservations about concluding any contracts with Palantir. This is a problem for the US company.\n\nPrivate client manager McShane says: “We have offered our products to various agencies, but so far without success. We remain very open to cooperation.”\n\nThe fears of the Swiss army (like those of German civil society activists), namely that sensitive data could be transferred to the US, are unfounded, Palantir emphasises. According to the company, customers always retain full control over their data and all subsequent analysis and decision-making processes.\n\nHowever, even without government clients, Switzerland is still a strategically important market for Palantir, McShane explains. “We have long-standing partnerships here that have significantly shaped both our engagement with global markets and the ongoing development of our products.” The US company works with a “critical mass” of leading Swiss firms, which include publisher Ringier, insurance firm Swiss Re, the former Credit Suisse bank and pharma giant Novartis. McShane does not give a precise number of companies involved.\n\n“Zurich is a key location for the continued growth of our European operations,” Bowman says. Palantir CEO Alex Karp is a fan of Switzerland and a frequent visitor to the Zurich office, he adds.\n\nIt appears that Zurich’s business location promoters have been striving to achieve this for years. As research by the Swiss online news magazine Republik and the WAV research collective reveals, two semi-public location organisations have been working to attract Palantir to Switzerland in recent years.\n\n## A success for Swiss business location promoters\n\nAn internal administrative document reveals that, back in 2016, a representative of the Aargau cantonal authorities wrote to the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM). He sensed a big opportunity for Switzerland: the well-known US company Palantir was planning to “onshore” its IT operations. This meant that its global business would no longer be managed from the US, but from a European location. The cantonal representative asked the SEM for a letter of reference to highlight the attractiveness of his canton.\n\nSoon after, the federal government took matters into its own hands. In 2018, then-government minister Ueli Maurer, from the right-wing Swiss People’s Party, visited Palantir’s headquarters in Palo Alto, California. The trip was organised by the official Swiss organisation for export and investment promotion, Switzerland Global Enterprise, which had long expressed interest in attracting Palantir to Switzerland.\n\nThe organisation had already summarised Palantir’s demands for its future location in a written briefing in 2016: an attractive package of (unspecified) incentives and taxes, good availability of skilled workers, proximity to urban centres, a strong tech cluster, and streamlined work permit processes.\n\nPalantir planned to create several hundred jobs, and Switzerland seemed to meet the company’s requirements. The big news came in 2021. Palantir announced that it was establishing its European hub – not in Aargau, however, but in the small, low-tax municipality of Altendorf in canton Schwyz, which borders Lake Zurich. CEO Karp also announced his personal move to the canton. The canton was delighted. The company would bring “skilled jobs” to the emerging tech cluster on Lake Zurich, said Urs Durrer, head of Schwyz’s Office for Economic Affairs.\n\nShortly afterwards, the business region’s marketing association, known as Greater Zurich Area, published its own video seriesExternal link about Palantir’s arrival. Palantir manager Bowman reveals on the website that he found Greater Zurich Area and Schwyz’s director of economic affairs Durrer “extremely helpful” during the location process.\n\nA few years after the media hype, however, it is clear that neither CEO Karp nor Palantir have settled permanently in canton Schwyz.\n\n## Zurich as a hub for Palantir\n\nIn June 2025, Palantir made headlines mainly because of footage of brutal US immigration enforcement (ICE) agents who had tracked down migrants using their softwareExternal link. At the same time, Greater Zurich Area published another promotional videoExternal link featuring Palantir. In it, Bowman talks about the expansion of Zurich as a business location and says that the city reminds him of the early days of Silicon Valley.\n\nThe company has been in Zurich for several years, he says in the video. The location offers many advantages: the mountains and lakes, a high standard of living, access to talent and world-renowned educational institutions. “Zurich is a place where people want to live,” he says.\n\nBowman also says that the city has become an important “hub” for Palantir’s growth: “Our presence in Zurich remains a key part of our international business.”\n\nBy now, Palantir has also established firm links with the Swiss establishment – especially the Ringier media group. Laura Rudas is not only executive vice-president of Palantir but also a former member of Ringier’s board of directorsExternal link. And Ringier board chair Marc Walder heads the association digitalswitzerlandExternal link, of which Palantir is also a member. Ringier is, moreover, a long-standing client of Palantir and extended its cooperation last year for another five years, including for the development of AI projects. Just recently, the media publisher even offered Palantir CEO Karp an advertising platform for his products in the form of an uncritical interviewExternal link (in German).\n\nBut how do the Zurich-based investment promotion agencies themselves view their role in attracting this controversial company? Greater Zurich Area is circumspect, saying that it did not actively seek to attract Palantir. The company set up shop here on its own initiative, they say.\n\nBut this answer is a huge understatement.\n\nA whole ecosystem of big tech companies is emerging in Zurich, very much as a result of the city’s favourable conditions and an active policy for attracting foreign companies: low taxes, a well-educated workforce and a high degree of political stability. Research by Republik and WAV has shown, for instance, how Google Switzerland was wooed by the left-wing city government and former Social Democrat mayor Elmar Ledergerber. This had consequences, as one example shows: Zurich’s main energy provider EWZ allegedly dropped everything whenever a Google employee called.\n\n## More\n\n### Switzerland’s uphill climb to AI sovereignty\n\nThis content was published on Nov 7, 2025 Switzerland has invested millions to reduce its dependence on American tech giants. But for many, true sovereignty in artificial intelligence (AI) remains out of reach.\n\nAs Greater Zurich Area vaunts on its websiteExternal link, the Zurich region now has a higher density of big tech companies than Silicon Valley. Google, Open AI, Microsoft, Meta and Apple are either setting up their European headquarters here or have already done so. Almost all of these companies have also become active in the military sector in recent years and supply products that, among other things, support Israel and its military operations in the Gaza Strip.\n\nPalantir, in particular, plays a central role here. The company has moreover just signed a ten-year, $10 billion contract External linkwith the US military.\n\nIt is at this point, at the very latest, that regulatory questions arise for the new tech mecca of Zurich. Specifically, these centre on Palantir’s possible contribution to Israel’s military operations in Gaza. Can products that are developed and sold here be exported to countries at war without further ado?\n\n## What exactly is Palantir working on in Switzerland?\n\nIn the meeting with McShane and Bowman, it becomes clear what role Zurich plays in Palantir’s business today. Around 60 people work in the city on the development and distribution of various software products. This also means that engineers were directly involved in developing Palantir’s products on site. However, the executives emphasise that the controversial Gotham platform, which is primarily used in law enforcement and military operations, is not being worked on in Zurich. Instead, staff here are focusing on the further development of Foundry, which is mainly used in the civilian sector.\n\nBut an increasing number of government agencies are also using Foundry. And Bowman and McShane admit that the software can be used in a military context. It was originally developed for the US for “counter-insurgency operations” in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n## More\n\n### The ethics of artificial intelligence\n\nThe challenges are immense for Switzerland, which is one of the leading developers of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThis raises the question: are the activities of the Zurich-based Palantir developers subject to Swiss export control regulations?\n\nNo, says the company. And no business directly related to Israel is conducted from Zurich.\n\nThe export supervisory authority of the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs seems to agree. Although Palantir’s products are classic dual-use items – meaning they can be used for both civilian and military purposes – and thus technically fall under the Goods Control Act, there is a regulatory gap here. There are currently no specific export controls for new technologies, particularly AI. Intense discussion is currently under way in national and international bodies about how to close this loophole.\n\nIn Switzerland, Social Democrat parliamentarian Farah Rumy has submitted a motion on the issue. She wants the federal government to ensure that products and IT services developed, operated or manufactured in Switzerland are not used in internal or international conflicts. This could well concern Palantir in the future.\n\nPalantir’s role in Gaza has now also brought the Swiss foreign ministry onto the scene. The reason is that Switzerland has a mercenary law, which applies to companies that provide private security services abroad from Switzerland and is intended to prevent Swiss companies from contributing to human rights violations. Logistical support, such as the establishment and maintenance of IT infrastructure, also falls under this legislation.\n\nSuch companies are obliged to register with the federal government, and all planned activities outside of Switzerland must be declared to the foreign ministry.\n\nThe foreign ministry must investigate ex officio any credible allegations related to the mercenary law. Following an enquiry by Republik and the research collective WAV, as well as numerous media reports on Palantir’s activities, the ministry is now taking action. After all, Palantir’s CEO himself admits that its software solutions can also kill people.\n\nWhen contacted, a Swiss foreign ministry spokesperson said that an examination was under way to establish whether such a declaration obligation exists for Palantir.\n\nIf so, Palantir would have to register its activities and obtain approval from a Swiss authority. The company would then also officially be considered a Swiss military technology company.\n\n## Zurich partly responsible\n\nAlthough Palantir has so far run into a brick wall with the Swiss authorities, the intelligence service and the army, the company seems to be satisfied with its choice of Zurich.Exactly what conditions Palantir’s Swiss business location promoters have fulfilled remains a secret. It is thus also still unclear whether Palantir has been granted the same “short lines of communication” – that is, quick, direct contact with the authorities – and attractive tax conditions as Google Switzerland.The fact remains, however, that Zurich is partly responsible for the growth strategy of Palantir, a company whose software is increasingly being used as a deadly weapon of war against civilians – and which clearly has no problem with this.

An hour later, the website showed “a login page with the Palantir logo,” and, a couple of hours after that, “the Palantir logo was replaced with an Education Department logo,” the outlet wrote.\n\nForeignfundinghighered.gov tracks foreign gifts and contracts data for higher ed institutions. If a foreign source provides a college or university more than $250,000 in a year, Section 117 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 requires the institution to report the payment to the federal government.\n\n#### Most Popular\n\n-   [George Washington U Pauses Admissions to 5 Ph.D. Programs](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/graduate-students-and-postdocs/2026/01/26/george-washington-u-pauses-admissions-5-phd)\n-   [Alliance Forms to Protect Higher Ed From Political Meddling](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2026/01/28/alliance-forms-protect-higher-ed-political-meddling)\n-   [Making Credit for Learning Easier for Students to Access](https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/columns/beyond-transfer/2025/10/23/making-credit-learning-easier-students-access)\n\nIn an email to _Inside Higher Ed,_ the Education Department described Palantir’s involvement in the past tense. It said Palantir was involved with the foreign funding portal as a subcontractor for Monkton, a company that has long handled privacy and data issues for the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security.\n\n“After soliciting feedback from institutions of higher education, the Trump Administration has upgraded the portal to make it easier for colleges and universities to report their foreign gifts and contracts as required,” Julie Hartman, the Education Department’s press secretary for legal affairs, said in a statement.\n\nThe AAUP held a news conference Wednesday raising concern about Palantir’s past work and about critical statements that Palantir leaders [Alex Karp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-NVtsOF6qU) and Peter Thiel had made about higher ed.\n\n“We want transparency,” AAUP president Todd Wolfson told reporters. “We want to know what Palantir is doing on this contract and we want to know how much they stand to make.” He said it “seems to be yet another front aimed at surveilling and criminalizing our colleges and universities,” and could indicate a “shift toward treating higher education not as a public good, but as a security threat to be monitored.”\n\nThe department didn’t tell _Inside Higher Ed_ how much Palantir is being paid. Hartman said “universities’ clear disclosure and public transparency requirements have been in statute for decades,” adding that the AAUP’s “baseless assertion that the portal is a ‘politicized punitive action’ demonstrates their utter disregard for the rule of law.”\n\nShe said, “the Trump Administration is ending the secrecy surrounding foreign dollars and influence on American campuses.” Palantir spokespeople didn’t return _Inside Higher Ed_’s requests for comment.",

    "content": "Since 2022, the Ukrainian government has actively cooperated with the U.S. IT company Palantir, which specializes in large-scale data analytics and information systems. Today, however, it is increasingly difficult to consider these solutions fully secure. Moreover, there is a growing risk that Ukraine's critical defense data may now be exposed.\n\nThese concerns are rooted in a 2024 audit conducted by the Swiss Armed Forces General Staff of Palantir's IT system for military intelligence services. While the audit confirmed the system's high technical capabilities, it also identified a significant likelihood that sensitive data could be accessible to the U.S. government and American intelligence agencies. As a result, Switzerland decided to discontinue the use of Palantir solutions.\n\n> Read more: U.S. Has Ordered Development of the SBI Orbital Interceptor Designed to Shoot Down Nuclear Missiles Immediately After Launch\n\nAt the same time, in May 2023, Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation signed a memorandum of cooperation with Palantir covering defense-related applications and post-war reconstruction efforts.\n\nThe specific systems involved were not disclosed, as the official announcement lacked technical details. It merely stated that the memorandum concerned \"digital capabilities\" in the defense sector, as well as the exchange of \"data and experience in implementing leading global technologies with the support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\"\n\nPalantir's involvement, however, began even earlier. On June 2, 2022, a meeting took place in Kyiv between President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, and Palantir CEO Alex Karp.\n\nThis cooperation has been broad and deep, directly affecting the combat capabilities of Ukraine's Defense Forces, intelligence collection, and strike planning against russian troops.\n\nIn February 2023, Alex Karp publicly stated that Ukraine was using Palantir's situational awareness system for direct targeting. According to him, the platform aggregates data from numerous sources, ranging from social media to satellite imagery, enabling Ukrainian forces to identify and track enemy units.\n\nIn 2022, 2023, and even throughout 2024, cooperation with Palantir was objectively a strategically sound choice. Even if Palantir's systems allowed U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA (which played a role in the company's early funding), to observe activity within these platforms, there was a prevailing assumption that Ukraine would, in any case, receive extensive intelligence support from the United States as a strategic partner and ally.\n\nThat assumption has now changed.\n\nWith Donald Trump's return to power, Ukraine and Europe have entered a new political reality. The updated U.S. National Security Strategy clearly indicates that the United States no longer views itself as an ally of Ukraine or Europe, and in many respects not even as a partner. It is also important to recall that Palantir's co-founder and major shareholder, Peter Thiel, was one of the key financial backers of Donald Trump's election campaign.\n\nUnder these circumstances, it may be necessary to very carefully reassess the use of any Palantir software, as well as the hardware on which it is deployed. This is particularly relevant given that Palantir solutions are no longer confined to the defense sector. For example, about a year ago it was announced that Palantir technologies would be used in demining operations and in the education sector.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Ukraine is not alone in facing this dilemma. Since 2022, Palantir has signed multiple agreements with European governments. Its involvement in security and defense-related projects has been reported in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Poland.\n\nThe largest customer, however, remains the United Kingdom. In September 2025, the UK Ministry of Defence signed a five-year contract worth £750 million (€855 million) with Palantir, extending an earlier agreement concluded in 2022.\n\n> Read more: U.S. Created LUCAS Attack Drone Squadron, then Admitted Warheads Don't Exist Yet",

    "content": "**Palantir expanded its lawsuit against two former employees on Thursday to include the CEO of [artificial intelligence](https://www.hrgrapevine.com/hr-glossary/artificial-intelligence) startup, Percepta AI.**\n\nThe company alleged that Percepta CEO and co-founder Hirsh Jain, co-founder Radha Jain and a third employee, Joanna Cohen, violated their non-solicitation agreements, hiring top talent to create a competitive business.\n\nThe suit accused the three defendants of attempting to poach executives and developers from their former company and \"plunder Palantir's valuable intellectual property.\" Palantir said the defendants were entrusted with the company's \"crown jewels,\" including source code, customer workflows and proprietary customer engagement strategies.\n\nPercepta denied using any of Palantir's confidential information, calling the case \"baseless,\" and said in a statement that the company was \"cherry-picking out-of-context soundbites.\" It added that \"Palantir does not own the AI transformation space, which is massive and constantly evolving.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"This is the latest in Palantir's effort to use fear tactics to bully ex-employees out of innovating with applied AI.\"\n\n## **Claims of recruitment efforts and internal messages**\n\nCohen and Radha Jain were previously senior engineers at Palantir. They were named in the original lawsuit filed in October, and both denied the initial allegations in a November filing. They also agreed to stop working for Percepta during the proceedings.\n\nPalantir said that Hirsh Jain, who was responsible for the company's health-care portfolio before resigning in August 2024, had engaged in an \"aggressive campaign\" to recruit other employees to join Percepta. The suit said the startup has already hired at least 10 former Palantir employees. A message allegedly written by Hirsh Jain in November 2024 read, \"I'm down to pillage the best devs at palantir when they're at their maximum richness.\" The complaint says Radha Jain wrote another message saying, \"God, thinking about poaching is so fun.\"\n\n## **Allegations involving confidential documents**\n\nPalantir also accused Cohen of sending herself highly confidential documents shortly after announcing her resignation from the company in March. Cohen allegedly took photos of sensitive information and downloaded files onto her personal phone. The company claimed, \"At Percepta, they seek to succeed not through old-fashioned ingenuity and competition, but through outright theft and deceit.\"\n\nPalantir is asking for the defendants to be forced to return any confidential information in their possession and to avoid working at Percepta or venture backer General Catalyst for 12 months from the time of an order.",

    "content": "The U.S. Navy has contracted with Palantir Technologies for nearly $450 million to enhance its submarine supply chain using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Palantir, a prominent defense technology contractor, specializes in systems for analyzing manufacturing activities, managing intelligence data, and improving tactical targeting processes. Known for its work on the mission command platform for U.S. Special Operations Command, as well as various sensor integration projects for the U.S. Army, Palantir will develop a system called Ship OS. This platform aims to streamline parts ordering and delivery for major nuclear submarine contractors, including Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) and General Dynamics Electric Boat, in addition to three public shipyards involved in submarine repairs.\n\nNavy Secretary John Phelan emphasized that this investment will provide essential resources for shipbuilders, shipyards, and suppliers, enabling them to modernize operations significantly. By leveraging AI and autonomous tools at scale, the initiative aims to enhance scheduling efficiency, increase operational capacity, and reduce costs within the shipbuilding sector.\n\nThe rollout of Ship OS builds upon preliminary trials funded by the BlueForge Alliance at General Dynamics Electric Boat and HII Newport News. Initially referred to as “Warp Speed for Warships,” these test applications utilized Palantir’s Foundry product, yielding substantial labor savings in production scheduling and material reviews.<\n\nThe implementation of the Ship OS program will fall under the Navy’s Maritime Industrial Base (MIB) program, which is a government initiative focused on supporting and reorganizing private sector resources to cater to Navy requirements. The submarine supply chain is currently under significant stress, and the MIB aims to achieve cost and efficiency gains that could offset the initial outlay for the project. A critical goal is to reduce delays in the production timetable for submarine programs, ensuring that manufacturing and repair operations are back on track—a vital aspect of national security. Upon successful integration within the submarine sector, there are plans to extend Ship OS to surface ship programs as well.\n\nAdditionally, last year, the Navy announced a separate $920 million contract with Palantir, covering a five-year period for diverse software, hardware, and consulting services, underscoring the increasing reliance on advanced technology to enhance military capabilities and operational efficiency.",

    "content": "Palantir, the artificial intelligence and data analytics company, has quietly started working on a tech platform for a federal immigration agency that has referred dozens of individuals to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for potential enforcement since September.\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agency—which handles services including citizenship applications, family immigration, adoptions, and work permits for noncitizens—started the contract with Palantir at the end of October, and is paying the data analytics company to implement “Phase 0” of a “vetting of wedding-based schemes,” or “VOWS” platform, according to the federal contract, which was posted to the U.S. government website and reviewed by _Fortune_.\n\nThe contract is small—less than $100,000—and details of what exactly the new platform entails are thin. The contract itself offers few details, apart from the general description of the platform (“vetting of wedding-based schemes”) and an estimate that the completion of the contract would be Dec. 9. Palantir declined to comment on the contract or nature of the work, and USCIS did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nBut the contract is notable, nonetheless, as it marks the beginning of a new relationship between USCIS and Palantir, which has had long-standing contracts with ICE, another agency within the Department of Homeland Security, since at least 2011. The description of the contract suggests that the VOWS platform may very well be focused on marriage fraud and related to USCIS’ recent stated effort to drill down on duplicity in applications for marriage- and family-based petitions, employment authorizations, and parole-related requests.\n\nUSCIS has been outspoken about its recent collaboration with ICE. Over nine days in September, USCIS [announced](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/uscis-announces-results-of-operation-twin-shield-a-large-scale-immigration-fraud-investigation) that it worked with ICE and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to conduct what it called “Operation Twin Shield” in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area, where immigration officials investigated potential cases of fraud in immigration benefit applications the agency had received. The agency reported that its officers referred 42 cases to ICE over the period. In a statement published to the USCIS website shortly after the operation, USCIS director Joseph Edlow said his agency was “declaring an all-out war on immigration fraud” and that it would “relentlessly pursue everyone involved in undermining the integrity of our immigration system and laws.\n\n“Under President Trump, we will leave no stone unturned,” he said.\n\nEarlier this year, USCIS rolled out updates to its policy requirements for marriage-based green cards, which have included more details of relationship evidence and stricter interview requirements.\n\nWhile Palantir has always been a controversial company—and one that tends to [lean into](https://fortune.com/2025/10/16/palantir-ceo-alex-karp-interview-shareholder-letters/) that reputation no less—the new contract with USCIS is likely to lead to more public scrutiny. Backlash over Palantir’s contracts with ICE have intensified this year amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration and aggressive tactics used by ICE to detain immigrants that have gone viral on social media. Not to mention, Palantir inked a [$30 million contract](https://www.wired.com/story/ice-palantir-immigrationos/) with ICE earlier this year to pilot a system that will track individuals who have elected to self-deport and help ICE with targeting and enforcement prioritization. There has been pushback from [current](https://fortune.com/2025/10/16/palantir-ceo-alex-karp-interview-shareholder-letters/) and [former employees](https://fortune.com/2025/08/06/palantir-alex-karp-top-25-valuable-companies-world-but-not-in-fortune-500/) of the company alike over contracts the company has with ICE and Israel.\n\nIn a recent interview at the _New York Times_ DealBook Summit, Palantir CEO Alex Karp was asked onstage about Palantir’s work with ICE and later what Karp thought, from a moral standpoint, about families getting separated by ICE. “Of course I don’t like that, right? No one likes that. No American. This is the fairest, least bigoted, most open-minded culture in the world,” Karp said. But he said he cared about two issues politically: immigration and “reestablishing the deterrent capacity of America without being a colonialist neocon view. On those two issues, this president has performed.”",

(Courtesy: Palantir: Q3 2025 Earnings Webcast)\n\nPalantir CEO Alex Karp on Wednesday argued that Americans have lost trust in major institutions because powerful executives routinely avoid consequences for their failures, saying \"poor people\" are \"the only people who pay the price for being wrong in this culture.\"\n\nSpeaking at The New York Times' annual DealBook Summit during a discussion about whether the federal government should take equity stakes in strategically important companies, Karp accused major corporations of running to the White House for help after making \"stupid decisions,\" while ordinary Americans are left with nothing.\n\n\"No one believes the institutions are credible … and I struggle to believe they're credible too, because these business leaders make completely stupid decisions, and they get bailed out,\" Karp said. \"A year later, they're getting huge bonuses.

    "date": "2025-12-03T17:45:49+00:00",
    "publisher": "The Washington Post",
    "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/12/03/palantir-immigration-ice/",
    "content": "For years, Alex Karp, Palantir’s CEO, had declared the data management company to be [“involved in supporting progressive values,”](https://www.businessinsider.com/palantir-wikileaks-apology-2011-2) saying he has [repeatedly “walked away”](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/06/29/palantirs-alex-karp-on-the-intersection-of-big-tech-and-politics.html) from contracts that targeted minorities or that he found otherwise unethical. Even as Palantir took on extensive data management contracts for the federal government, the company said it was not willing to allow its powerful tools to broadly track immigrants across America.\n\nThat commitment no longer holds. Palantir’s software is helping U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement track undocumented immigrants and deport them faster, according to federal procurement filings and interviews with people who have knowledge of the project and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details. The software, Immigration OS, plays a key role in supporting the administration’s mass deportation campaign, which President Donald Trump has stepped up in recent days with such measures as [pausing immigration applications](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/12/02/trump-immigration-applications-paused-19-countries/) from nationals of 19 countries.\n\nKarp, formerly an outspoken Democrat who a decade ago said that he respected “nothing” about Trump and that a deportation drive made “no sense,” has staunchly defended the president’s immigration policies in his second term. Declaring Palantir to be “completely anti-woke,” he has repeatedly praised Trump’s ongoing crackdown on immigrants, thrusting the company into one of the country’s most contentious issues.\n\nThat shift in political alliances in no way signals a change in his core beliefs, Karp said in a statement to The Washington Post, portraying his commitment to controlling immigration as of a piece with his long-standing devotion to social justice.\n\nDemonstrators block the entrance to Palantir's New York offices in July, chanting slogans such as “No ICE, No Palantir!” (Lokman Vural Elibol/Anadolu/Getty Images)\n\n“For over two decades, I have implored our political elite to take seriously the truly progressive position on immigration: one of extreme skepticism. To no avail,” Karp said. “Unfettered immigration in Europe, where I lived for well over a decade, has been a disaster — depressing wages for the working class and resulting in mass social dislocation. I remain an economic progressive, isolated among self-proclaimed progressives that are anything but.”\n\nThe changes at Palantir have been driven by multiple factors, according to five of the people familiar with the company’s project. Palantir executives saw Trump’s election to a second term as a mandate from voters for stricter border control, the people said, and, like many other companies, Palantir has changed some policies in response to executive orders targeting diversity in hiring and other issues. They added that [Karp’s support of Israel](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/13/palantir-ceo-says-outspoken-pro-israel-views-led-employees-to-leave-.html) after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack has drawn him closer to Republican national security hawks.\n\n![](https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/static/my-post/images/topics/trump-tracker-180px.png)\n\n**Follow** Trump’s second term\n\nPalantir’s federal contracting business has bloomed during the Trump administration. Its September tally of new federal contracts was $128 million, its largest monthly sum on record, according to [USASpending.gov](http://usaspending.gov/). The company’s stock price is up more than 120 percent this year, as it rides its contracting wave and the boom in companies that, like Palantir, are centered on the development and use of AI.\n\nPalantir has long defied simple political characterization. For years, it has worked with administrations of both parties on projects other Silicon Valley firms shunned, such as the Pentagon’s [Project Maven AI target identification system](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/08/01/palantir-trump-defense-tech-ai-software/). But its support for ICE on a deportation crackdown punctuated by violent clashes and stiff court challenges has sparked debate among current and former employees over whether it runs afoul of the company’s values and endangers its bipartisan profile.\n\nSeven months into the project, which was renewed in late September, some Palantir employees still harbor concerns about Immigration OS, according to two of the people familiar with the matter. They say some Palantir staff members have been discussing whether the contract should be discontinued if ICE’s use of the technology veers into extrajudicial actions or violate the company’s civil liberties principles. It couldn’t be determined whether the company’s senior executives are involved in those discussions. A Palantir spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nICE and its parent department, the Department of Homeland Security, declined to answer questions about Immigration OS. DHS said in a statement that Palantir has been a contractor for 14 years, providing “solutions for investigative case management and enforcement operations” to ICE. “DHS looks holistically at technology and data solutions that can meet operational and mission demands,” it said.\n\nICE awarded Palantir a $30 million contract on April 11 to build an “Immigration Lifecycle Operating System,” or Immigration OS for short. Its aim, according to procurement filings by the agency, is to facilitate the “selection and apprehension operations of illegal aliens” based on ICE priorities, minimize “time and resource expenditure” in deportations, and track in “near real-time” which individuals leave the country voluntarily. Palantir won the contract without a competitive bidding process, with ICE citing an “urgent and compelling need” and stating that “Palantir is the only source that can provide the required capabilities … without causing unacceptable delays.” ICE renewed the contract on Sept. 25, bringing its total value to about $60 million — a relatively small amount in the context of Palantir’s$2.87 billion revenue in 2024.\n\nIn an internal communication to employees in the spring, Palantir presented the project as a “prototype” and said “longer-term engagements” were “TBD,” [according to a copy obtained by 404 Media](https://www.404media.co/this-is-palantirs-justification-for-building-ices-master-database/). The company said it was “pursuing this effort because we believe it is critical to national security and that our software can make a meaningful difference in the safety of all involved in enforcement actions.”\n\nICE and Palantir have declined to disclose how many people the system tracks, which agencies it pulls data from, and whether there are safeguards against mistaken identity or overcollection of surveillance data. Shyam Sankar, Palantir’s chief technology officer, told the New York Times in [a recent interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/opinion/palantir-shyam-sankar-military.html) that Immigration OS tracked encounters at the border, asylum applications and applications for benefits. Immigration OS does not track information of U.S. citizens who are relatives of undocumented immigrants, Palantir said in an emailed statement.\n\nICE adopted Immigration OS as it rolled out a campaign to identify and detain what it calls the “Worst of the Worst.” The agency has cited cases of undocumented immigrants committing serious crimes as justification for broad deportation sweeps through cities such as Chicago, Charlotte and Portland, Oregon. ICE and Palantir declined to say whether Immigration OS played a role in helping compile ICE’s “Worst of the Worst” lists.\n\nTrump said on Thanksgiving Day that he would “permanently pause” migration from “Third World Countries,” broadly deport undocumented immigrants, and end all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens. That would mark an escalation of a campaign that federal judges have [repeatedly ruled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/08/29/trump-deportation-expedited-removal/) exceeds [the administration’s legal authority](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/11/federal-judge-curbs-dhs-force-against-journalists-la/), with one Chicago judge saying last month that the use of force involved [“shocks the conscience.”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/11/06/judge-sharply-condemns-federal-use-force-chicago-immigration-operation/) DHS has decried the rulings as coming from “activist judges” and said its actions have been lawful.\n\nIn [an interview with Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/alex-karp-goes-to-war-palantir-big-interview/) published in November, Karp said he had previously “pulled things” that he believed were being deployed in violation of the company’s code of conduct, while rejecting contentions that its immigration software is. Asked whether he needed to take a closer look at how Palantir’s products were being used in the United States, he called it “exactly the right question,” adding: “I’m telling you that I have done this, and I will continue to do it.”\n\nWendy R. Anderson, who was Palantir’s senior vice president for national security until May, said Karp has never wavered in his conviction that tech companies working in defense have a duty to the country, not to politics.\n\n“Alex starts from a single, nonnegotiable premise: America has to win,” she said, speaking generally and not in reference to Immigration OS. “Not in a partisan sense, but in the enduring one — the survival of the United States and the Western institutions that make free societies possible.”\n\nPalantir, founded by Karp and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel in 2003 in the wake of 9/11, has long drawn criticism from civil rights activists over the powerful data management tools it sold to the likes of the Pentagon, CIA and ICE.\n\nKarp — the son of a Jewish father and African American mother who took him to civil rights protests when he was a child — has long been outspoken in his self-identification as a Democrat and his beliefs in privacy protections. “We as a company, and I as an individual, always have been deeply involved in supporting progressive values and causes,” Karp [said in 2011](https://www.businessinsider.com/palantir-wikileaks-apology-2011-2).\n\nIn summer 2015, shortly after Trump announced his first major presidential run, Karp told his staff that he had turned down an opportunity to meet Trump, as “it would be hard to make up someone I find less appealing,” according to [a leaked video published by BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/williamalden/video-shows-palantir-ceo-ridiculing-trump-and-slamming-his). Karp said he opposed Trump’s broad deportation platform, saying it made “no sense” to throw out hardworking people. He said blaming immigrants for the nation’s ills would bring up “the worst that a society can bring up.”\n\nDuring Trump’s first presidency, Palantir said it would not work directly with ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations arm on deportations, citing the risk of human rights violations. The company limited its contracts to the agency’s Homeland Security Investigations division, which worked on issues such as terrorism, sex trafficking and drug smuggling, though in practice [there was at least some crossover with raids on undocumented immigrants](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/22/war-inside-palantir-data-mining-firms-ties-ice-under-attack-by-employees/).\n\nPalantir had made that distinction, Courtney Bowman, the company’s director of privacy and civil liberties, [wrote in a 2020 letter](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/letter-from-palantir-responding-to-amnesty-international/) to Amnesty International, “because we share your organization’s concern with the potential serious human rights violations against migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border and risks of disproportionate immigration enforcement inside the U.S.”\n\nCritics say Immigration OS represents a breach of those principles. The project has drawn public backlash, including from Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham, who [wrote on X](https://x.com/paulg/status/1913338841068404903) that Palantir was “building the infrastructure of the police state.” In a public letter, 13 of the company’s former employees accused Palantir’s leadership of being “complicit” in “normalizing authoritarianism” in America.\n\nWithin Palantir, executives defended the project by citing changing voter sentiment on the border issue and changes to ICE’s structure. In one of his first executive orders in January, Trump had ordered ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations to prioritize immigration enforcement instead of national security.\n\n“The national conversation around immigration enforcement, both at the border and in the interior of the United States has shifted,” the company wrote in the internal communication obtained by 404 Media. Palantir said it had realized that “to really support the agency’s immigration enforcement mission, we must expand our aperture … this means supporting workflows that are substantially distinct from our historical scope and into Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO).”\n\nThe policy reversal prompted some employee resignations. Brianna Katherine Martin, who had been a U.S. government strategist at the company for almost three years, left in May, citing the recent expansion of the company’s work with ICE.\n\n“For most of my time here, I found the way that Palantir grappled with the weight of our capabilities to be refreshing, transparent, and conscionable,” Martin wrote on LinkedIn. “This has changed for me over the past few months.” She did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe deepened partnership with ICE has come amid other changes at the company.\n\nPalantir revised its employee code of conduct in March, removing pledges to avoid biased decision-making and eschew unfair action based on race or national origin. The “Protect the Vulnerable” section of the code previously said: “We will not create or perpetuate the unfair treatment and/or stigmatization of individuals or groups, particularly when such unfair action is based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, disability, age, ancestry, marital status, citizenship, or sexual orientation.” The new version pledges more generally to avoid unfair action “based on any characteristic protected by federal, state, or local laws.”\n\nPalantir also deleted a section that said employees should strive to overcome conscious and unconscious biases in their decision-making. The section now says employees should engage with one another with respect.\n\nThe code-of-conduct changes were made in response to Trump executive orders unrelated to the company’s ICE business, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the shift. Trump [had forbidden](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity/) federal contractors from “illegal” diversity practices in January.\n\nKarp biographer Michael Steinberger, whose book “The Philosopher in the Valley” was published last month, said his interviews revealed Karp’s increasing exasperation with what he saw as the Democratic Party’s unwillingness to control the border and preoccupation with identity politics.\n\n“He has definitely moved to the right,” Steinberger said. “Though I suspect he would be more inclined to say that he thinks the left left him.”\n\nAn important factor in Karp’s rightward shift has been the Oct. 7 attack on Israel two years ago**,** Steinberger wrote in his book. “I’m now very willing to overlook my disagreements with Republicans on other issues because of the position they have taken on this one,” he quotes Karp as saying in the book.\n\nIn [a letter](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr51/0211/2025/en/) in July to Amnesty International, responding to questions about its ICE contracts, Palantir said that although it took the human rights risks of its work with governments seriously, its role was to serve as a responsible federal contractor and uphold the law, not to set U.S. government policy.\n\n“Palantir is not an oversight authority entrusted with scrutinizing or questioning executive branch actors,” the company wrote.\n\n_Elizabeth Dwoskin, Douglas MacMillan, Gerrit De Vynck, Marianne LeVine and Aaron Schaffer contributed to this report._",

    "content": "Anthropic and Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR) today announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide U.S. intelligence and defense agencies access to the Claude 3 and 3.5 family of models on AWS. This partnership allows for an integrated suite of technology to operationalize the use of Claude within Palantir’s AI Platform (AIP) while leveraging the security, agility, flexibility, and sustainability benefits provided by AWS.\n\nThe partnership facilitates the responsible application of AI, enabling the use of Claude within Palantir’s products to support government operations such as processing vast amounts of complex data rapidly, elevating data driven insights, identifying patterns and trends more effectively, streamlining document review and preparation, and helping U.S. officials to make more informed decisions in time-sensitive situations while preserving their decision-making authorities. Claude became accessible within Palantir AIP on AWS earlier this month.\n\nWith Palantir's AIP, customers can now operationalize Claude using an integrated suite of technology, facilitated by Amazon SageMaker, an accredited fully managed service, and hosted on Palantir's Impact Level 6 (IL6) accredited environment, supported by AWS. Palantir and AWS are among a limited number of companies to receive the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) IL6 accreditation requiring some of the strictest security protocols.\n\n“Our partnership with Anthropic and AWS provides U.S. defense and intelligence communities the tool chain they need to harness and deploy AI models securely, bringing the next generation of decision advantage to their most critical missions,\" said Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer, Palantir. “Palantir is proud to be the first industry partner to bring Claude models to classified environments. We’ve already seen firsthand the impact of these models with AIP in the commercial sector: for example, one leading American insurer automated a significant portion of their underwriting process with 78 AI agents powered by AIP and Claude, transforming a process that once took two weeks into one that could be done in three hours. We are now providing this same asymmetric AI advantage to the U.S. government and its allies.\"\n\n\"We're proud to be at the forefront of bringing responsible AI solutions to U.S. classified environments, enhancing analytical capabilities and operational efficiencies in vital government operations. Access to Claude 3 and Claude 3.5 within Palantir AIP on AWS will equip U.S. defense and intelligence organizations with powerful AI tools that can rapidly process and analyze vast amounts of complex data. This will dramatically improve intelligence analysis and enable officials in their decision-making processes, streamline resource intensive tasks and boost operational efficiency across departments,\" said Kate Earle Jensen, Head of Sales and Partnerships, Anthropic.\n\n“We are excited to partner with Anthropic and Palantir and offer new generative AI capabilities that will drive innovation across the public sector. At AWS, we are committed to providing public sector customers and partners with the most secure, innovative, and comprehensive set of cloud services,” said Dave Levy, VP, Worldwide Public Sector, AWS.\n\n**About Palantir Technologies Inc.**\n\nFoundational software of tomorrow.
